title: 'Feature link list'
description: 'A compact list of navigational links with optional descriptions and directional icons.'
component-type: Navigation
---


Use a feature link list to present a group of related navigational links in a sidebar or in-page panel. Each item consists of a link title, an optional short description, and a directional icon that animates on hover. The component is designed to sit alongside primary content, not to replace it.

Always accompany a feature link list with a clear heading. Without a heading, the list lacks context and users cannot assess whether the links are relevant to them.

## When to use this component

- the links share a common context and can be grouped under a single heading
- the list supplements the main content area, placed within the page's main region
- descriptions are available for all or most links – aim to use them consistently across the list
- descriptions add genuine value by clarifying what the destination contains, not restating the link title
- the component is the right choice when links to external sites are unavoidable – it renders a different icon for external destinations to signal that a new tab will open

## When not to use this component

- outside the main content region
- for primary navigation
- when links do not share a common theme – a plain rich text list is sufficient
- when you have more than eight items – consider a table, a card grid, or a section landing page
- to link to sections on the current page.

## Writing link text and descriptions

- make each link label clear, concise, and distinguishable from the others – screen reader users navigate by link text alone
- do not open links in a new tab unless unavoidable; when you must, always use the external link icon so users know what to expect
- do not repeat the link label in the description – use the description to add new information
- keep descriptions to three lines of copy or fewer; longer text undermines the component's purpose as a quick-scan navigation aid
- if most links have descriptions, add one to all – a mix of described and bare links looks unfinished and is harder to scan

## Without descriptions

Omit descriptions when links are self-explanatory and supporting text would add no new information. 

If most links have descriptions, add one to all – a mix of described and bare links looks unfinished and is harder to scan.

## Icon-leading variant

The icon-leading variant places a decorative icon at the start of each item and removes the trailing arrow. Use this variant when items represent actions the user initiates (such as suggested prompts) rather than destinations they navigate to.

Descriptions are not typically used in this variant; the link text should be self-explanatory. Items in this variant do not open in a new tab and do not use the external-link icon.

## Accessibility

Each link must have clear, concise, and descriptive link text. Links that share the same label (for example, multiple 'Read more' links) are inaccessible to screen reader users who navigate by link text. Each link should be distinguishable from the others without relying on surrounding context.

Meeting this requirement supports users with cognitive disabilities and users who navigate with a screen reader or keyboard.
