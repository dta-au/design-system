description: 'An accordion lets users show and hide sections of related content.'

## When to use this component
Only use an accordion if there’s evidence it’s helpful for the user to:

- see an overview of multiple, related sections of content
- choose to show and hide sections that are relevant to them
- look across information that might otherwise be on different pages

For example, an accordion can work well if the user needs to reveal and compare information that’s relevant to them.

Accordions can also work well for people who use a service regularly. For example, users of caseworking systems who need to do familiar tasks quickly.

Test with users to decide if using an accordion outweighs the potential problems with hiding content.

## When not to use this component
Accordions hide content from the user. Not all users will notice them or understand how they work. For this reason, you should only use them in specific situations and if user research supports it.

Do not use an accordion for content that all users need to see.

Test your content without an accordion first. Well-written and structured content, as shown in the Content design: writing for GOV.UK guidance, can remove the need to use an accordion.

It’s usually better to:

- simplify and reduce the amount of content
- split the content across multiple pages
- keep the content on a single page, separated by headings
- use a list of links at the start of the page (known as ‘anchor links’) to take the user to particular sections of a page

Accordions work best for simple content and links. Do not use accordions to split up a series of questions. Use separate pages instead.

Do not put accordions within accordions, as it will make content difficult to find.

Do not use the accordion component if the amount of content inside will make the page slow to load.

## Canonical anti-patterns

These are the recurring misuses of the accordion on digital.gov.au. Each one destroys something the page was trying to do.

**Standards or criteria collapsed into accordion panels.** Each criterion has its own URL, its own deep-link target, and is referenced individually from compliance reviews, search results, and JSON-LD `hasPart` relationships. Hiding criteria inside accordion panels destroys those references. Use a card grid of [navigation cards](/patterns/card-selection/) instead, with each criterion linking to its own [rule page](/templates/rule/).

**Glossary terms collapsed into accordion panels.** Glossaries are skimmed, not browsed. An accordion forces a click per lookup, and the [DefinedTermSet](https://schema.org/DefinedTermSet) JSON-LD shape is lost when the term and definition are not co-located in the rendered DOM. Use semantic `<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>` markup instead. See the [reference template](/templates/reference/).

**Checklist items collapsed into accordion panels.** Checklists must be readable end-to-end and printable. An accordion breaks both. Use a real ordered or unordered list.

**Inputs and outputs of a framework step collapsed into accordion panels.** A reader on step 7 of a framework often needs to cross-check step 4's outputs. Hiding step structure behind accordions makes the framework harder to use, not easier.

**'FAQ-style' accordion on an explainer page.** If the questions are real and the answers are useful, write them as `<h3>` body sections – they then appear in search results and an in-page table of contents. Accordion-FAQ on an explainer hides the answers from readers who skim.

## Canonical right uses

The right place for an accordion is a [reference FAQ](/templates/reference/) – each question is independently a lookup key, the page is long, and the user usually wants only one answer.

Even there, apply [callout discipline](/patterns/callout-discipline/): if a single question accounts for the bulk of reader traffic, lift its answer into a callout above the accordion. The accordion handles the long tail.
