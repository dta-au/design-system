description: 'Presenting contact information so users can reach the right team through the right channel.'

Use this pattern whenever you need to help users contact a team or agency. Choose the right format based on how prominent the contact information needs to be relative to the surrounding content.

## Choosing a format

**Inline body text** – the default. Use when contact information is a natural part of the page flow and does not need visual separation. Write the channel and detail in a sentence.

**Callout** – use when contact information needs to stand out from surrounding content – for example, at the end of a page or within a form. Use the contact information variant of the [Callout](/components/callout/) component.

**Details component** – use when contact information is less important than the main content and should be hidden by default. Wrap it in the [Details](/components/details/) component only when there are three or more lines of contact detail. Do not use it to hide a single phone number or email address.

## Channel ordering

Order contact channels based on what your users most commonly need and what your service can best support. Show channels in the same order throughout your service – consistency helps users find what they need.

A common order is:

1. Online (form, portal, or chat)
2. Email
3. Phone
4. Postal address

Do not include a channel just because it exists. Only list channels that are actively monitored and where users will receive a timely response.

## Formatting rules

Make every phone number accessible using a `tel:` URI so it is tappable on mobile devices. Follow the format established in the [Style Manual for telephone numbers](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/telephone-numbers).

For example, write the link as: `<a href="tel:+61299999999">02 9999 9999</a>`

Do not use bullet points or a colon after 'Call' or 'Email'.

Do not use a full stop after an email address.

Use a heading written for your users, not an internal label. If the contact section relates to a specific task, write 'Get help with your registration' not 'Contact us'.
