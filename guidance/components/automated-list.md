Use an automated list to display content items – news, events, resources, or other content types – that are drawn automatically from the CMS based on configured criteria such as content type, tags, or date range. The list updates as new content is published without editors needing to manually curate it.

The automated list is an advanced component because it requires CMS view configuration to define what content appears and how it is ordered.

## When to use

- you need a listing that stays current as new content is published
- the items share a content type or tagging structure that can be queried reliably
- the listing volume is too large to manage manually

## When not to use

- when you need to handpick and order specific items – use [Manual list](/components/manual-list/) instead
- when the content does not have consistent metadata – an automated list relies on structured tagging to display correctly
- for featured or promotional content – use [Promo](/components/promo/) or [Feature link list](/components/feature-link-list/) instead

## Related components

- [Manual list](/components/manual-list/) – use when items should be handpicked and ordered by the editor.
- [Feature link list](/components/feature-link-list/) – use when each link benefits from a description and hover icon.
