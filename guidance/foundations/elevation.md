title: 'Elevation'
description: 'A set of predefined tokens that establish a sense of depth and layering – through shadows, glow, and z-index – to communicate hierarchy and interaction state.'

## Shadow vs glow

The system distinguishes between two types of visual elevation:

**Shadow** communicates **physical depth** – that an element floats above the surface it sits on. Shadows are directional, darker at the base, and simulate a light source above. They are used for structural elements: cards, dropdowns, modals, popovers.

**Glow** communicates **attention state** – that an element is interactive or live right now. Glows are non-directional, use the accent colour at low opacity, and signal UI feedback rather than layout hierarchy.

A glowing card implies it is interactive or active. A shadowed card implies it sits above the page. These are different messages, but they can coexist: shadow establishes the physical presence of an element at rest; glow layers on top when that element is hovered or live.

## Shadow tokens

Three levels correspond to increasing stacking depth:

| Token | Purpose | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `--shadow-sm` | Minimal lift – slightly elevates interactive elements | Inline cards, compact components, table action rows |
| `--shadow-md` | Standard elevation – further elevates interactive elements on hover | Cards, sidebars, sticky elements |
| `--shadow-lg` | Maximum depth – elements that float above the page | Modals, dialogs, dropdowns, drawers |

All shadow values use two layers: a large soft spread for ambient shadow and a small tight spread for the contact edge. This two-layer technique avoids flat or plastic-looking results.

In dark mode, shadow opacity increases to compensate for the reduced contrast between the raised surface and the dark background. At very deep dark backgrounds, shadows approach invisibility – this is where glow takes over as the primary depth signal.

## Glow token

| Token | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--glow` | Exception-state signal for interactive raised surfaces; primary depth signal in dark mode |

The glow uses the accent colour at low opacity. It has two layers: a tight 1px halo (acts like a coloured border) and a diffuse 16px spread.

Glow works as a signal precisely because most elements do not have it. Applied broadly it loses meaning entirely. The system's border, shadow, and lift tokens already handle interaction affordance – glow is not a replacement for any of those, it is additive and reserved.

**Light mode – hover only, highest-emphasis elements**

Glow at rest in light mode competes with the other signals already present on a component (accent border, subtle background, shadow lift). Three signals for one message is noise. Reserve glow for the single most important hover moment in a page region – typically the primary action button or a curated featured card. Do not apply it to ordinary cards, secondary buttons, or list items.

**Dark mode – rest state on raised surfaces**

Neutral shadows become near-invisible on dark backgrounds (dark-on-dark). Glow becomes the primary signal that a surface is elevated or interactive. This is where the token earns its place in the system. Apply at rest on `--bg-raised` surfaces in dark mode; on hover, increase shadow lift rather than intensifying the glow.

**Live or real-time elements**

The one legitimate rest-state exception in light mode: a component actively broadcasting data – a live feed card, a status indicator that is currently updating – can carry glow at rest to communicate "this is alive now." Borders and shadows cannot convey this; glow can.

## Z-index tokens

A set of predefined values for handling the relative distance between surfaces along the z-axis.

| Token | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `base` | `0` | The base z-index. |
| `elevated` | `1` | Elevates elements above adjacent elements that sit on the base z-index. |
| `overlay` | `100` | Overlays in modals and components that sit above the page – Modal, Drawer, mobile navigation. |
| `dialog` | `110` | The main dialog element in modals and other components – Modal, Drawer, mobile navigation. |
| `popover` | `200` | Popover elements – for example, calendar in a date picker. |
| `skipLink` | `999` | Focused skip links. |

## Do

- use `--shadow-sm` to slightly elevate interactive elements like cards at rest
- use `--shadow-md` to further elevate interactive elements on hover
- use `--shadow-lg` only for elements that float above the page – dropdowns, modals, drawers
- combine shadow at rest with glow on hover: `box-shadow: var(--shadow-md)` → `box-shadow: var(--shadow-md), var(--glow)`
- use `--glow` at rest in dark mode on raised surfaces where shadow is insufficient
- use z-index tokens rather than arbitrary values to maintain consistent layering

## Don't

- apply `--glow` to elements that are not interactive or live – it creates false affordance
- apply `--glow` to every card or surface – it loses signal value when overused
- apply `--shadow-lg` to small UI components – scale shadow to the physical size of the element
- use `--glow` for selected state – that is handled by `--selected` and `--selected-muted`
- use `--glow` in place of the focus ring – glow is a pointer-hover signal, not a keyboard-navigation signal
- use arbitrary z-index values outside the token scale – this breaks stacking order guarantees
